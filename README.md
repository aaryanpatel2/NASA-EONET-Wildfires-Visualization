# NASA EONET Wildfires Visualization

A real-time data visualization of wildfires using Python to retrieve data from NASA's EONET REST API
and creating a scatterplot in Matplotlib after parsing JSON for coordinates of the wildfires. A Flask
app will be created as well with the integration of Tableau and MySQL.

This project aims to learn new concepts and tools such as Flask, Tableau, MySQL, and REST API while developing my Python skills.
